## Game Description

You play as a ninja in feudal Japan tasked with stealing a precious gem from an enemy encampment.
Explore the village to find the artifact, avoiding enemies and then return to your
intial position to escape from the camp and win the level!. Use your abilities to
be the best ninja possible. But careful! The artifact you are recovering is very heavy
effect, so you won't be able to use some of your abilities after obtaining it.

### Abilities
* Moving (WASD): essential to any ninja.
* Jumping (Space Bar): use your jump to quickly traverse the level.
* Dashing (Q): get away from enemies fast by getting a boost.
* Marking (E): mark the enemy currently in your crosshair to be able to see them through walls.
* Sneaking (F): turn invisible for a few moments to keep enemies from seeing you.
* Croushing (Left Shift): being in a lower stance makes you harder to see from away.
